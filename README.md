We can add some fancy description/summary here

## Suggested workflow - MVP
The work is timeboxed, and with that in mind, you need to change how you approach the task. You will want to employ an iterative approach. 

* Write a plan of how you will complete the project. Refer to this regularly.
* When unsure or facing overly complex topics: make assumptions or simplifications that allow you to move on with your plan.
* Make simple plots
* Main questions should be answered first -> Think MVP (minimum viable product) and POC (proof of concept) 
* Iterate: go deeper, go prettier, go better
* Clean up .. feel free to delete things that are not useful anymore (even if you spent loads of time on it!)
 

**Have fun and do not stress yourself too much!!!**
